Pipeline panic is a modern browser based re-interpretation of the [Pipe Mania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_Mania) video game originally published in 1989. Built for educational purposes.

You can play the game here: [webcloud.se/pipeline-panic](https://webcloud.se/pipeline-panic)

## Game objective

Build a pipe that goes from start to end.

The grid will have two pipes S (start) and E (end), your goal is to connect these pipes while earning as much Pipeline Dolares (¤) as possible. The longer the pipe, the more ¤ you are likely to earn. You will have **30 seconds** to build your pipe before the panic starts.

Once the panic starts, pink sludge will flow from the start pipe. If you haven't completed your pipe the sludge will start leaking and the game is lost
If you have completed the pipe and the sludge reaches the end pipe the game is won.

### How to play

Tap/click anywhere on the grid to place a new pipe. You can also replace existing pipes (but to a higher cost)

Next to the grid, you'll se a list of pipes available to you. When placing a pipe it will pick the pipe at the front of this list.

### How to earn ¤

- You start with ¤50 in the bank
- You earn ¤50 for every tile that gets filled with sludge
- It costs ¤1 to place a tile
- It costs ¤2 to replace an existing tile

Be careful! You can't go below ¤0, meaning you won't be able to replace or place new tiles if you run out of money.

If there is a leak, all your money is lost and the game is over.

Good luck!

Pipeline panic is a modern browser based re-interpretation of the [Pipe Mania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_Mania) video game originally published in 1989. Built for educational purposes.

## Game objective

Build a pipe that goes from start to end while earning Pipeline Dolares (¤)

You will have 30 seconds to build your pipe before the panic starts.

Once the panic starts, pink sludge will flow from the start pipe. If you haven't completed your pipe the sludge will start leaking and the game is lost

If you have completed the pipe and the sludge reaches the end pipe the game is won

## How to earn

- You start with ¤50 in the bank
- You earn ¤50 for every tile that gets filled with sludge
- It costs ¤1 to place a tile
- It costs ¤2 to replacing an existing tile

Be careful! You can't go below ¤0, meaning you won't be able to replace or place new tiles if you run out of money.

To achieve a high score you need to finish the pipe from start to end.

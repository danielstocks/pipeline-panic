# Pipeline Panic

Save the world before the pink sludge consumes us all!

## Game objective

Build a pipe that goes from start to end.

You will have 30 seconds to build your pipe before the panic starts.

Once the panic starts, pink sludge will flow from the start pipe. If you haven't completed your pipe the sludge will start leaking and the game is lost

If you have completed the pipe and the sludge reaches the end pipe the game is won

## How to earn

To achieve a high score you need to finish from start to end and earn Pipeline Dolares (¤)!

- You start with ¤50 in the bank
- You earn ¤50 for every tile that gets filled with sludge
- It costs ¤1 to place a tile
- It costs ¤2 to replacing an existing tile

Be careful! You can't go below ¤0, meaning you won't be able to replace or place new tiles if you run out of money.
